\usage{
wilmoth_control(
  c = 6,
  intercept = TRUE,
  tol.biweight = 1e-06,
  tol.lsfit = 1e-07,
  radix = 1e+05,
  k.int = c(-25, 20),
  nu = 1,
  nv = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{Tuning constant when compute weighted least squared using 
Tukey's biweight function. Typically, between 6 to 9.}

\item{intercept}{logical. Whether or not an intercept term should be used in 
least squares estimation. See \code{\link{lsfit}}.}

\item{tol.biweight}{Tolerance for convergence of the biweight fit}

\item{tol.lsfit}{Tolerance to be used in the matrix decomposition in 
least squares estimation. See \code{\link{lsfit}}.}

\item{radix}{Life table radix. Default: 10^5;}

\item{k.int}{a vector containing the end-points of the interval to be 
searched for k parameter.}

\item{nu}{The number of left singular vectors to be computed in SVD method. 
This must between 0 and n = nrow(x). See \code{\link{svd}}.}

\item{nv}{the number of right singular vectors to be computed. 
This must be between 0 and p = ncol(x). See \code{\link{svd}}.}
}
\value{
List with control parameters.
